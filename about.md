I am Robert, and this is my little corner of the internet. My plan is to share some of the insights and curiosities I run into during the course of my day-to-day life – be it software engineering, photography, travel, or just life in general. I hope you will enjoy reading these random posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

Now I will entertain you with some facts about myself so you can construct a blunt mental image of my personality and traits.

I love wearing headphones while I [`gD`](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Go_to_definition_using_g) myself into the deepest corners of bits of machines that
goes "Ping!". I like to lift weights - [fast and heavy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap_VXMoLklQ).
I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38827605-robert-kuska) and [capturing](https://www.instagram.com/entropyunfolding/) random moments
with my camera (these two hobbies are probably unrelated). And I like looking at photographs of others (that's
where books and photography intersect) and taking long walks (luckily, as a European without a car, this is easy!). Occasionally, I turn my hand to baking, specializing in delectable cinnamon buns and chocolate babka.
(If you've never had [babka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zE2Kb8sn1k), you're missing out!)

And here's my full resume in case you're interested in having me as a colleague.

### Skills
Golang, Python, Postgresql, Cassandra, Scylla, Backend engineering, Monitoring, Leadership, Software Architecture, Microservices, Docker, VIM, Linux

### Experience
Here are a few things I've learned over the years,
> An optimist is simply a pessimist with no job experience.

> All of your co-workers are fools. You must learn to pity and tolerate them.

> There are very few problems that can't be solved through a suitable application of high explosives.

### Publications

### Why Σ and 伝える
<span class="color-green">Σ</span> is used to denote alphabet in Automata theory (which happened to be my favorite subject at university). <span class="color-green">Σ^\*</span> is then set of all possible strings over the alphabet Σ. It reminds me of my favorite quote from 
<span class="color-green">M\*A\*S\*H</span>:

> Interviewer: Is there anything from home that you brought over with you to set up for yourself? Creature comforts?  
Hawkeye: I brought a book over.  
Interviewer: What book?  
Hawkeye: The dictionary. I figure it's got all the other books in it. I like to read the dictionary.  

<span class="color-green">伝える</span> is from japanese and translates as <span class="highlight-blue">"to convey"</span>. Therefore it is a nice name for blog.
