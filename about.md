I am Robert, and this is my little corner of the internet. My plan is to share some of the insights and curiosities I run into during the course of my day-to-day life – be it software engineering, photography, travel, or just life in general. I hope you will enjoy reading these random posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

Here are some facts about myself so you can construct a blunt mental image of my personality and traits.

I love wearing headphones while I [gD](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Go_to_definition_using_g) myself into the deepest corners of bits of machines that
goes "Ping!". I like to lift weights - [fast and heavy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap_VXMoLklQ).
I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38827605-robert-kuska) books and [capturing](https://www.instagram.com/entropyunfolding/) random moments
with my camera (these two hobbies are probably unrelated). And I like looking at photographs of others (that's
where books and photography intersect) and taking long walks (luckily, as a European without a car, this is easy!). Occasionally, I turn my hand to baking, specializing in delectable cinnamon buns and chocolate babka.
(If you've never had [babka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zE2Kb8sn1k), you're missing out!)


### Skills
Golang, Python, Kafka, Postgresql, Cassandra, Scylla, Backend engineering, Monitoring, Leadership, Software Architecture, Microservices, Docker, VIM, Linux

### Experience
- **Qonto / Backend** *(January 2020 - PRESENT, Remote)*  

At Qonto, I'm a **Staff Software Engineer** on the Ledger team, dedicated to our bookkeeping operations. We tackle resource-intensive processes, handling vast transaction batches. Since joining, I've played a key role in our ongoing migration from a synchronous HTTP-based flow to an **event-driven** architecture, utilizing Kafka as our messaging queue. 

I also **lead our Golang coding academy**, mentoring newcomers in the art of backend Go development.  Often, I find myself driving technical scalability initiatives – optimizing batch processes to reduce execution time and database strain, and benchmarking our services to guarantee they can withstand surges in traffic.

- **Kiwi.com / Backend** *(November 2015 - December 2019, BRNO, CZECH REPUBLIC)*

I began my journey as a **Senior Software Engineer** in the Booking tribe, specializing in backend development for core booking creation and payment fraud detection services. My responsibilities included being the on-call expert for critical systems.

Later, I transitioned into a **Tech Lead**, pioneering Kiwi.com's first Go backend team within the Search tribe.  I was instrumental in migrating our flights storage from Cassandra to Scylla, a **fully distributed database** (3 data centers, 7 nodes each). This system handled a staggering **700k writes and 500k reads per second**. Continuous optimization was key, leveraging profiling and tracing to enhance our services.

- **Red Hat / Software Engineer** *(APRIL 2013 - APRIL 2016, BRNO, CZECH REPUBLIC)*

I worked on a user experience team managing cPython within Fedora and RHEL products. One of my major accomplishments was spearheading the transition to Python 3 as the default, successfully completed for Fedora 23. Additionally, I co-authored PEP-493, providing HTTPS verification migration tools for Python 2.7.

### Talks

### Why Σ and 伝える
<span class="color-green">Σ</span> is used to denote alphabet in Automata theory (which happened to be my favorite subject at university). <span class="color-green">Σ^\*</span> is then set of all possible strings over the alphabet Σ. It reminds me of my favorite quote from 
<span class="color-green">M\*A\*S\*H</span>:

> Interviewer: Is there anything from home that you brought over with you to set up for yourself? Creature comforts?  
Hawkeye: I brought a book over.  
Interviewer: What book?  
Hawkeye: The dictionary. I figure it's got all the other books in it. I like to read the dictionary.  

<span class="color-green">伝える</span> is from japanese and translates as <span class="highlight-blue">"to convey"</span>. Therefore it is a nice name for blog.
